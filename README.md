# the-keyboard-design-checklist
There always were beloved and hated keybords. Some are even materialized practical jokes and even pranks.

Let's delve into predicting (as in creating) what comprises an excellent keyboard.

## Intended use & audience
Not all keyboards are created equal. And some intentionally so. Let's see what considerations at all come into play when desiging one?

### The show room queen
* OLED - check
* Standard row stagger - check
* Latest an greatest QMK/ZMK fork for firmware - check
* Web GUI for keyboard layout and dediucated OS/platform customisation app - check
* Underglow in RGB - check
* per keyu RGB - check
* Latest GMK keycaps from Drop - check
* Pudding (side translucent ekycaps) - check
* *Feelios* (sarcastically generalized factory lubricated MX style switch reference) - check
* coiled cable with in_the_middle aviator jack - check
  
See? it ticks all the boxes yet you will never see it worn on my desk, nor on any artist or PC worker's desk either. As the title implies it is more of an artistic artifact than an actual daily driver product.

Forgot the CNCed brass keycaps...

### The best seller
There Are those keyboards that everyone has a piece of. All have been used. Most of them end up tucked away. Everyone has an oppinion of his own one.<br>
Some break and end up being too expensive to repair.<br>
Some just get out of favor.<br>
Other were never "right" to settle on. Always that one more feature missing. <br>

### The idol
Once upon a time that was **Topre**. A keyboard everyone desired yet barely anyone could afford.

Today it's **Keymacs** - an absolute delight to work on, layout somewhat debatable but entirey usable and the price you could buy a 2nd PC for and even then one quite competitive at gaming or even serious work to say the least.

There will always be real keyboards that define the stuff dreams are made of. And that is just fine, just not affordabe for everyone.

### The work horse
Some keyboards really are just that - more often than not those end up to be the most unassuming ones in the end: some random **HP** or **Chicony** run of the mill. Or even 2nd hand or gifted **Leopold**.

When those break they usualy get an immediate replacement, once that replacement (usually the same make and model) breaks people even end up making one good out of two bads.

What happens? How come those exist after all the money poured into the former few? Read on, we're chasing *exactly that answer* here!

### The EDC toy
You know, it looked so cute! It was just the right size (and price for that matter!).

It fits the backpack just perefect!

It doesn't use up much space at all!

Alas! It has issues wit:
* that particular OS driver
* is against the company policy (to be used on the work place)
* it's too feeble
* misses a key or a feature
* misses more keys or features
* clicky switches (bitching innit?)
* the canle plug wastes too much desk space
* looks too unproffesional and embarasing to be actually used in the actual work environment.
* It is in the end just a toy and nothing more.

### The EDC workhorse
When buying and actual daily drive a *cary along keyboard* make sure that:
* it's actually silenced/dampened - it takes more than foam modding to comply with that.
* rugged desing means actual metal plate, a case that can handle falling from the desk to the floor and can handle repairs should the worst happen.
* it has QMK firmware with options to meet OS reuirements in the environment it will be used in - *as the only keyboard or input device*.
* it's "features" like light effects and sounds (or knocks) can be readily turned off when the situation demands it.
* the size and layout is comfortable and productive for prolonged use
* it is safe to be actually used an doperated in the actual work environment. Some labs have issues with some sorts of metals if the cases is conductive or non coated.
  
### The self defense weight
The best keyboards, most agree were from the era they were comissioned from the government and acquired for the miltary. The lucky few who happen to own those dread at the very ieda of transporting those overweight megaliths. But operating them is still a delight and something of a conversation starter on many enthusiast meetups...

### The compulsory purchase(s)
Hello my name is \<Name and Surname here\>, I am a keyboardholic. This is my collection \<Instagram or Imgur URL\>
* Some keyboards just happen to look too good on a stnad or in a shelf.
* You have to put all those fantastic keycaps on something
* It is a rare model and Wouldn't we all hate someone took it apart and salvaged it for the rare switches?
* I just happen to had that amount of meny at my side
* This is the last one i promise.

## Elements
The keyboard desing elements don't end with:
* Case
* Plate
* Switches
* Circuitry (be it on a board or wires hung mid air - aka handwired)
* Connection cable (or medium if wireless)

People usualy forget mot keyboards have collapsible feet. Some even can be tented. But there is way more to keyboard elements than just that...

### Safe keys
When you want to "wake" the computer or interrupt it's idel state but not interrupt it's current task of focus point you seek wha'ts called a "safe key".

Unlike "any key", a key that is expected to be pressed and wichever key is pressed the iput will be disregarded, a "safe key" is such a key that aside it will be detected by the OS (some keys are not detected if pressed alone or once - it's by design) won't result, preferably in a undesired action, ideally just none at all.

One of cuch keys is the **Control** key, the others are **Alt** and **Caps lock**. The later has to be pressed an odd number of times to have absolutely no effect, but the odd presses ought to toggle the LED on the keyboard - if this fails to happen it usually is an unintrusive troubelshooting sign.

Now that we have established what safe keys are, can we agree the a wise designer will try to put at least one more more such keys on the most corners of a kayboard?

The standard ANSI/ISO has it's left most bottom row key be **Ctrl** a key safe to press any time in most sessions and programs that will be running on any PC.

Having no suck keys readily accesible along the contour of the keyboard is certainly a sing onf bad desing or insufficient desing consideartion.

### Negative space
Negative space are empty areas that form blocks or clusters on a kayboard:
* Macro block (left most on legacy XT style layouts)
* The Function row (top most row where the **Escape** key resides)
* The Alphanumneric block (basically what's a 60% keyboard)
* The Nav block (3 columns that usually hold the cursor arrow keys)
* The Numpad, or Number block - right most bock on the standard ANSI layout comprising of mostly numbers and basic math symbols)

Those blocks function by the very empty space that makes them appear insular.

There are keybopards that capitalize on exactly saving up on that space (the 96% size).

They have a reputatiuon of being clumsy to quickly navigate from block to block.

Even the highly praised "1800" design can overwhelm the causal user with it's lumped tugether numpad and navblock, but the space surrounding the arrow keys more than makes up for that.

Good designers cleverly use negative space to their best advantage. Space of 0.25U is usually regarded as unfit to be covered by the case "blocker" and is either left with the plate showing or a plate mounted blocker is used instead. Such blockers can mount status ledsm badges or other non functional or non input features.

### Tactile and other feedback mechanisms
Tactility is good. Mankind has used the tactility of it's fingers from the dawn of time to it's best advantage. One of the greatest shortcomings of the otherwise superior touch screens is exactly that - lack of tactile feedback.

A good desing uses the tactile feedback to ti's best adavtage.

The original complicated (SCKM) **Alps** switches have the highest tactile reputation among all currently available options. The **Matias** and OPC (from **Tai Hao**) come close in second then the whole variety of more or less expensive and/or viable MX clones and lookalikes (**Kailh** BOX coes to mind).

Sadly, the most tactile (and satisfying to the user) switches are the most annoying "loud" or "clicky" ones - just like operating a clicky ball pen - what's soothing and satisfying to the operator more often than not annoys and rustles the nearby surrounding bystanders.

For the time there were even mechanical devices that would serve to validate the keybpres by a loud bump inside a volumiouns case.

Luckily these days are in the past and all readlily available switches come in dampened tectile or even linear (smooth travel) silenced variety.

It is worth to note that bast the **topre** membrane and **IBM**'s buckling spring all other swithces "fake" the activation event with a secondary element or device acting as tactile event generator. The notable exception being the **Cherry** clickjacket tactile clicky MX switch, altho it's design goal was to actually prevent accidental double activation events.

### Non functional features
Every once in a while there are those keyboards that seem to be aiming to amuse, shock or ridicule.

Whtever the ever eluding case might be, they catch the unasuming eye (and wallet) of the unsuspecting consumer with just that: non fucntional features:
* Sound enhancing or changing features (slits, cutouts, inserts...)
* Various cable setups (coiled cables with aviator pulgs mid cable) (just to be clar: i am perfectly aware a badly coiled cable will always tend sit somewhat uneven if there is no hefty (and otherwise totally unjustified) X16 aviator jack pair right at the end of the coil in the middle of the cable. Yes it's only purpose is to hold the cable down - it even looks uglym bulky and unasuming) 
* the OLED with the bongocat - if you have time and attention sapn to follow the bongocat - you shouldn't spoend the time on the computer anyway - take a walk in th epark instaed)
* A keyboard, in my view, is a input device - one you perate while your attention is directed eksewhere - i am very weary of *output* features on a keyboard, aside from status leds, and even then with a good sense of neasure!
* Idolatry on the bottom side - is just that - fancy weights made with preicey methods and out of pricey materials are just vasetullf use of resources. I doubt anyone will type more productive over a brass weight versus over a soft steel one. Especially if both are painted in gold color and never shown to anyone.
* Secondary fonts in languages that no one uses or can read. *Especially runes*

### Redundant functions
*TODO*

## Configuration
Some keyboards come as a single unit. other come as split halves - not even connected by a cable but powered each by ot's own battery. Other Come as a modular kit where the parts can even switch places so You can go from right hand side nupad to a true southpaw plugging it in on the left side!

### Units
The splitting of a keyboard is justified only if done right - it is of little use to split it and then only find out you keep seeking for the **B** key on the wrong side. Or find out you always use the right half of the split space, despite it being changed to backspace due to too smal number of keys chosen.

Those are the problems that shoot down an otherwise novel idea. Carelessly approaching Design iterations (yes! most good designs take few times to produce before done just right) leads to unforeseen expenses and premature burnout.

Picking the right quality of connector is important. the right type of connector even more so.

If not sure, stick to 14 pole **USB Type C with USB2.0 standard**. For everything.

### Communication standards
USB, Converters, Bluetooth, Custom wireless. Cable and connector picking.

*TODO*
## Build quality
### 3dprinted material choice and ramifications
### Layered or sandwiched appeal and limits
### DIY rugged case options
### Proffesional CNC cases
### Exotic materials
