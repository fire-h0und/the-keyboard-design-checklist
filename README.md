Note all the oppinions expressed here are that of the author. They might more or less differ from Yours or others. If You happen not to like some, try to agree we disagree and feel free to fork this and write up your own. 

There always were beloved and hated keybords. Some are even materialized practical jokes and even pranks.

Let's delve into predicting (as in creating) what comprises an excellent keyboard.

## Intended use & audience
Not all keyboards are created equal. And some intentionally so. Let's see what considerations at all come into play when desiging one?

### The show room queen
* OLED - check
* Standard row stagger - check
* Latest an greatest QMK/ZMK fork for firmware - check
* Web GUI for keyboard layout and dedicated OS/platform customisation app - check
* Underglow in RGB - check
* per key RGB - check
* Latest GMK keycaps from Drop - check
* Pudding (side translucent ekycaps) - check
* *Feelios* (sarcastically generalized factory lubricated MX style switch reference) - check
* coiled cable with in_the_middle aviator jack - check
  
See? it ticks all the boxes yet you will never see it worn on my desk, nor on any artist or PC worker's desk either. As the title implies it is more of an artistic artifact than an actual daily driver product.

Forgot the CNCed brass keycaps...

### The best seller
There Are those keyboards that everyone has a piece of. All have been used. Most of them end up tucked away. Everyone has an oppinion of his own one.<br>
Some break and end up being too expensive to repair.<br>
Some just get out of favor.<br>
Other were never "right" to settle on. Always that one more feature missing. <br>

### The idol
Once upon a time that was **Topre**. A keyboard everyone desired yet barely anyone could afford.

Today it's **Keymacs** - an absolute delight to work on, layout somewhat debatable but entirey usable and the price you could buy a 2nd PC for and even then one quite competitive at gaming or even serious work to say the least.

There will always be real keyboards that define the stuff dreams are made of. And that is just fine, just not affordabe for everyone.

### The work horse
Some keyboards really are just that - more often than not those end up to be the most unassuming ones in the end: some random **HP** or **Chicony** run of the mill. Or even 2nd hand or gifted **Leopold**.

When those break they usualy get an immediate replacement, once that replacement (usually the same make and model) breaks people even end up making one good out of two bads.

What happens? How come those exist after all the money poured into the former few? Read on, we're chasing *exactly that answer* here!

### The EDC toy
You know, it looked so cute! It was just the right size (and price for that matter!).

It fits the backpack just perefect!

It doesn't use up much space at all!

Alas! It has issues with:
* that particular OS driver
* is against the company policy (to be used on the work place)
* it's too feeble
* misses a key or a feature
* misses more keys or features
* clicky switches (bitching innit?)
* the cable plug wastes too much desk space
* looks too unproffesional and embarasing to be actually used in the actual work environment.
* It is in the end just a toy and nothing more.

### The EDC workhorse
When buying and actual daily drive a *cary along keyboard* make sure that:
* it's actually silenced/dampened - it takes more than foam modding to comply with that.
* rugged design means actual metal plate, a case that can handle falling from the desk to the floor and can handle repairs should the worst happen.
* it has QMK firmware with options to meet OS requirements in the environment it actually will be used in - *even as the only keyboard or input device*.
* it's "features" like light effects and sounds (or knocks) can be readily turned off when the situation demands it.
* the size and layout is comfortable and productive for prolonged use
* it is safe to be actually used and operated in the actual work environment. Some labs have issues with some sorts of metals if the case is conductive or non coated metal.
  
### The self defense weight
The best keyboards, most agree were from the era they were comissioned from the government and acquired for the miltary. The lucky few who happen to own those dread at the very ieda of transporting those overweight megaliths. But operating them is still a delight and something of a conversation starter on many enthusiast meetups...

### The compulsory purchase(s)
Hello my name is \<Name and Surname here\>, I am a keyboardholic. This is my collection \<Instagram or Imgur URL\>

* Some keyboards just happen to look too good on a stand or in a shelf.
* You have to put all those fantastic keycaps on something, right?
* It is a rare model and wouldn't we all hate someone took it apart and salvaged it for the rare switches?
* I just happen to had that amount of money at my side
* Yes it is a bad keyboard but my keycaps really stand out on it, and I never intended to use it for typing anyway....
* This is the last one i promise.

## Elements
The keyboard design elements don't end with:
* Case
* Plate
* Switches
* Circuitry (be it on a board or wires hung mid air - aka handwired)
* Connection cable (or medium if wireless)

People usualy forget most keyboards have collapsible feet. Some keyboards even can be tented. That brings us to the ...

### Keyboard angles

The usual keyboard lies on the desk at an angle from zero to two degrees, once the collapsible feet are folded out the angle can increase for about seven or up to eleven degrees.

Not all keyboard conform to these values.

The angling is dictated by both ergonomics and convenience - to see the labels from a more advantageous angle and to lessen the strain on the wrists while typing.

### Case

A decently designed keyboard unit will form a wedge that's lower on the closer end. This comforms to just how hands at typing work.

Typical frontend heights range from 18 to some 25 mm (3/4 to 1 inch) and the back heights are just happenstance and depend on the design itslef.

Some cases have an integrated **wrist rest** - it is a flat area thet can be used to lean the palms and wrists on while typing. Those keyboards that have none usually depend on the users acquiring a separate wrist rest or to type with the hands "hovering" above the desk.

Either option can lead to **RSSI** if used without planned breaks, sufficient *injury preventing exercise* while working and extremely *prolonged exposure to a single work pose*.

Remember: too much optimization produces as much injury as inadequate work conditions can.

Besides angles and sizes, the case characterizes also the weight. Some designers seem to lack confidence in designing a case as_is so they add all sorts of weights to the bottom as a sort of *design language*.

I am  yet to see a **keyboard weight** to play any role aside from hampering transport and mitigating what **decent feet** ought to entirely alleviate (unitended motion of the unit while in normal operation). Aside asserting *the bigger complex of inferiority*, the **logo adorned weight** will also let your peers know you are ready to *comparatively suffer more* to hide it with flashy yet ineffective things.

Good cases have **soft feet** that don't ever slip on any surface, and don't scratch or burr any desk if dragged across.

Properly designed case **relieves the cable and plug** from excessive stress and damage in all possible and even some unforseen use scenarios. A merely recessed USB plug is just that - both inadequate and a failure waiting to happen.

A **slot** for securing a keyboard with a lock and a steel rope/chain is a clear sign of a forward looking and mature designer.

Metal cases should have functional **grounding** measures that effectively connect it to the ground of the host device or aparatus the keyboard attached to.

A rugged case should **protect the switches** from extreme travel by not allowing them to bottom out before the case sits flush against a flat rigid surface - imagine stepping on an iverted keyboard lying flat on a reasonably flat floor

A rugged case should have **controlled liguid paths** for ingress and egress - liquid always finds a way in, but wise designers see it can quickly find the way out too.

Any radius smaller than 0.2 mm (~10 thou) is considered a **sharp edge** and while not a cutting hazard is certainly unpleasant to lean against. A good "soft" edge is a 45 degree chamfer that is 0.5 to 1.0 mm deep (0.7 to 1.4 mm across the surface).

Radiuses from 8.0 to 11.0 mm look nicely and human on the closest side if the design language mandates a rounded front side.

Do note there is no set of general measurs to define the ideal keyboard, everyone has just to find it's own.


### Plate design considerations

1. There is nothing wrong with an absolutely sturdy keyboard
2. There is nothing wrong with an squishy flexible keyboard
3. The right amount of flex & rigidity is merely a matter of personal preference
4. Do note that absolutely rigid keyboards never develop squeeking noises ever.
5. There are plates that don't span the whole surface of the key area

Valid plate materials are many and as can be seen, the pick is not mandated solely by the rigidity of the material.

The roles a plate plays in a design are quite few:
* Align and distribute 2/3 pin switches easily and evenly
* Change flexing/rigidity of the whole board or one or more areas
* Carry and stabilize the switches (some designs can even lack the entire PCB beneath)
* Seal off the internals from the environment (as some designs only have the plate and the lower housing)
* Carry the blockers, the LEDs/OLED/screen/feedback devices
* Carry a cool logo
* Conceal cool comments and art on the PCB (this art form is typically referred to "easter eggs")
* Connect the keyboard to the case

Typical plate materials are:
* None (the so called plateless keyboard)
* Painted mild steel sheet
* Aluminum (stamped or cut sheet or CNC'd blocks integral with the top housing)
* Stainless (typically 304, rarely 316 (marine proof keyboards?)
* Polycarbonate plastic sheet (very durable and flexible)
* Plywood or wood (birch, maple come to mind)
* ABS plastic (3d prints in an enclosure like a charm)
* PETg and or PLA - not suited for summer-time usage in cars or hot ambients (stable up to 50 degrees Celsius at most)
* Brass or Copper (those steampunk enthusiasts really seem to have money to burn, right?)
* Bronze or Titanium (some people just seem to yearn to know the machining was arduous and painstaking and otherwise just can't be happy?)

### Switches
Mechanical keyboards are a niche of the whole keyboard market, a niche that seems to be expanding (or at least was up unil very recently).

By that one understands an input device that holds more or less interchangeable modules called **key switches** that can either be soldered or plugged into dedicated sockets (the "hotswap" keyboard variety).

As of very recently beside metallic contacts, there have been magnetic, optical and non metallic contact switches offered on the market.

To pick the right switch it is a matter of preference, tehnical profficience and more often that not a matter of residence due to many recent shipping constrains.

I happen to like Kailh silent BOX while I am not endorsed or have had any offer or gift from them or any other company. I just genuinely happen to like them. Do note i don't like just every other Kailh's switch.

Aside from traditional switches there are a special variety called **rotary encoders**, it is a special sort of switch where it can be inferred at what direction amount and pace it is turning. The most popular have an adtional "push button" switch integrated on top. Their advantages are novely, satisfying tactile feedback (if of any quality) and intuitive UI traversal (turn & click). The disadvantages are fragility (if implemented improperly) and much lesser service time compared to a good key switch.

One can find other types of input and interaction devices among the switches on a keyboard like a **track-point**, **trackball** or a **trackpad**.

### Circutry

The keyboard's mechanical side is jut one half of the medal. The circuity and firmware is what gives it the final character.

Historuically we can divide making keyboards to before and after KiCAD 5.10 and JLC-PCB. What before was a costly and arduous adventure for the enlightened few has become a hobby and pastime for the masses. Allthough not big masses, but rather select few *particular* masses (i *thik* it's called *nerds*)

A keyboard is considered "handwired" if it has none or a PCB that does not reach to all or most of the key switches but barely carries the controller circuitry and possibly the USB cable plug.

Back in the day handwired was the only viable option for most options. Nowdays only the most sculpted designs (dactyl and the like) use this method for obvious reasons, alltho even there are single switch PCB to be readily ordered.

Competitive manufacturing services in China have made PCBs as accessible as never before - the PCB for a keyboard can be as low as $15 per unit without shipping, depending on the size and soewhat on the design.

With a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) the designer still has few options: to put a dedicated MCU (chip) on the very board or to use a daughter board (RP2040, Teensy 2.0 or some bluetooth variety) and use the PCB only for holding the key switches, routing traces and integrating the elements.

Either way there are more or less silly options one can implement:

- curved traces
- drop eye vias (a relict from the past when the etching imposed limitations to the copper mask)
- hatched ground plane (this is way cool in looks altho ridiculously unimportant and without effect aside that)
- ridiculous silkscreen comments
- logos across silkscreen, soldermask and copper mask ("multi color" logos)
- traces designed with more than just electrical design rules in effect (artistic traces)
- mouse bites (a tecnique to allow for ireversibly breaking off PCB segments)
- contoured PCB outline
- contoured holes inside the PCB surface (rectangular reverse soldered LED cutouts)
- light guides (see thru areas vacant of any copper traces thorought the PCB for light effects)
- per switch LED or RGB (WS2812 or WS2811)
- underglow with our without RGB & effects (even more WS281x)
- solenoid bumper (tactile feedback device)
- beeper (for maximum over russtle)
- flexible suspension elements (so the PCB and plate sandwich can flex one way or the other)
- hotswap connectors (so you can have three times more points of faiulre as if several tens of metallic contact switches wern't enough already)
- alternative connection methods (always missing that charging cable, eh?)

### Safe keys
When you want to "wake" the computer or interrupt it's idle state but not interrupt it's current task of focus point you seek what's called a "safe key".

Unlike "any key", a key that is expected to be pressed and wichever key is pressed the iput will be disregarded, a "safe key" is such a key that aside it will be detected by the OS (some keys are not detected if pressed alone or once - it's by design) won't result, preferably in a undesired action, ideally just none at all.

One of such keys is the **Control** key, the others are **Alt** and **Caps lock**. The later has to be pressed an odd number of times to have absolutely no effect, but the odd presses ought to toggle the LED on the keyboard - if this fails to happen it usually is an unintrusive troubelshooting sign.

Now that we have established what safe keys are, can we agree the a wise designer will try to put at least one more more such keys on the most corners of a kayboard?

The standard ANSI/ISO has it's left most bottom row key be **Ctrl** a key safe to press any time in most sessions and programs that will be running on any PC.

Having no such keys readily accesible along the contour of the keyboard is certainly a sign onf bad design or insufficient design consideartion.

### Negative space
Negative space are empty areas that form functional blocks or clusters on a kayboard:
* Macro block (left most on legacy XT style layouts)
* The Function row (top most row where the **Escape** key resides)
* The Alphanumneric block (basically what's a 60% keyboard)
* The Nav block (3 columns that usually hold the cursor arrow keys)
* The Numpad, or Number block - right most bock on the standard ANSI layout comprising of mostly numbers and basic math symbols)

Those blocks function by the very empty space that makes them appear insular.

There are keyboards that capitalize on exactly saving up on that space (the 96% size). They happen have a reputatiuon of being clumsy to quickly navigate from block to block.

Even the highly praised "1800" design can overwhelm the causal user with it's lumped tugether numpad and navblock, but the space surrounding the arrow keys more than makes up for that. And it's narrower than the full size ANSI while still keeping all standard keys.

Good designers cleverly use negative space to their best advantage. Space of 0.25U is usually regarded as unfit to be covered by the case "blocker" and is either left with the plate showing or a plate mounted blocker is used instead. Such blockers can mount status leds, badges or other non functional or non input features. There were commerically available keyboards that do cover 0.25U spaces with case level blockers or fill ins - namely the **Cherry 1800** series among others.

### Tactile and other feedback mechanisms
Tactility is good. Mankind has used the tactility of it's fingers from the dawn of time. One of the greatest shortcomings of the otherwise superior touch screens is exactly that - lack of tactile feedback.

A good design uses the tactile feedback to is's best adavtage.

The original complicated (SCKM) **Alps** switches have the highest tactile reputation among all currently available options. The **Matias** and OPC (from **Tai Hao**) come close in second then the whole variety of more or less expensive and/or viable MX clones and lookalikes (**Kailh** BOX coes to mind).

Sadly, the most tactile (and satisfying to the user) switches are the most annoying "loud" or "clicky" ones - just like operating a clicky ball pen - what's soothing and satisfying to the operator more often than not annoys and rustles the nearby surrounding bystanders.

For the time there were even mechanical devices that would serve to validate the keybpres by a loud bump inside a volumiouns case.

Luckily these days are in the past and all readlily available switches come in dampened tectile or even linear (smooth travel) silenced variety.

It is worth to note that past the **topre** membrane, **IBM**'s buckling spring and the **Cherry** clickjacket tactile clicky MX switch all other swithces "fake" the activation event with a secondary element or device acting as tactile event generator. Some solutions are so off one can make the switch close before the tactile event takes place, or opposite, make the tactile event happen before the switch closes. Worst case is to even have both happen on the same unit.

Other notable feedback mecahnisms are the illuminating ones:
* Status LEDs
* OLED status screen
* audible feedback (confirms every switch closing, or change of status or both)
* solenoid (some have such a heavy one the feedback is clearly tacitle even)

### Non functional features
Every once in a while there are those keyboards that seem to be aiming to amuse, shock or ridicule.

Whtever the ever eluding case might be, they catch the unasuming eye (and wallet) of the unsuspecting consumer with just that: non fucntional features:
* Sound enhancing or changing features (slits, cutouts, inserts...)
* Various cable setups (coiled cables with aviator pulgs mid cable) (just to be clar: i am perfectly aware a badly coiled cable will always tend sit somewhat uneven if there is no hefty (and otherwise totally unjustified) X16 aviator jack pair right at the end of the coil in the middle of the cable. Yes it's only purpose is to hold the cable down - it even looks uglym bulky and unasuming) 
* the OLED with the bongocat - if you have time and attention sapn to follow the bongocat - you shouldn't spoend the time on the computer anyway - take a walk in the park instaed)
* A keyboard, in my view, is an input device - one you operate while your attention is directed elsewhere - i am very weary of *output* features on a keyboard, aside from status leds, and even then with a good sense of neasure!
* Idolatry on the bottom side - is just that - fancy weights made with pricey methods and out of pricey materials are just vasteful use of resources. I doubt anyone will type more productive over a brass weight versus over a soft steel one. Especially if both are painted in gold color and never shown to anyone.
* Secondary fonts in languages that no one uses or can read. *Especially runes*

### Redundant functions
*TODO*

## Configuration
Some keyboards come as a single unit. other come as split halves - some not even connected by a cable but powered each by ot's own battery. Other Come as a modular kit where the parts can even switch places so You can go from right hand side nupad to a true southpaw rfe-plugging it in on the left side!

### Units
The splitting of a keyboard is justified only if done right - it is of little use to split it and then only find out you keep seeking for the **B** key on the wrong side. Or find out you always use the right half of the split space, despite it being changed to backspace due to too small number of keys per halve designed in.

Those are the problems that shoot down an otherwise novel idea. Carelessly approaching design iterations (yes! most good designs take few times to produce before done just right) leads to unforeseen expenses and premature burnout.

Picking the right quality of connector is important. the right type of connector even more so.

If not sure, stick to 14 pole **USB Type-C with USB2.0 standard**. For everything.

### Communication standards
*TODO*
USB, Converters, Bluetooth, Custom wireless. Cable and connector picking.

*TODO*
## Build quality
